# Stakeholder Requirements

The stakeholders for this project include real estate agents, property investors, and buyers who are looking to predict housing prices accurately. Their requirements are as follows:

## Requirements
- **Accuracy**: The model should have a low error rate and provide predictions with high accuracy.
- **Explainability**: The stakeholders need to understand the features that influence the predictions.
- **Real-time predictions**: The model should be able to provide predictions instantly through an API.
- **Scalability**: The model should be able to handle a large number of predictions concurrently.

## Success Metrics
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Measure of the model’s accuracy.
- **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**: To evaluate the explanatory power of the model.
- **Execution time**: The model should be optimized for fast inference times.
