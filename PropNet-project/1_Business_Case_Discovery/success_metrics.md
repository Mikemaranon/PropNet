# Success Metrics

The success of the project will be measured using the following metrics:

- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: A lower RMSE indicates that the model’s predictions are close to the actual values.
- **R² Score**: This metric evaluates the proportion of variance explained by the model. A higher R² score indicates better model performance.
- **Execution Time**: Time taken to generate predictions. The model should make predictions within a reasonable time frame (e.g., less than 1 second).
- **Model Generalization**: The ability of the model to perform well on unseen data is crucial for its success in a real-world environment.
