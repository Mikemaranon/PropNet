# Business Case Description

The business case for this project is to develop a predictive model for housing prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, etc. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the price of a property based on these attributes.

## Objectives
- To build a reliable machine learning model that can predict housing prices.
- To ensure the model performs well on unseen data.
- To deliver actionable insights that can help investors, buyers, and sellers make informed decisions.

## Scope
- Data collection and exploration.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Model building, evaluation, and selection.
- Deployment and API creation for predictions.

## Constraints
- Limited amount of data for training the model.
- External factors affecting housing prices, such as economic conditions, that may not be captured in the data.
