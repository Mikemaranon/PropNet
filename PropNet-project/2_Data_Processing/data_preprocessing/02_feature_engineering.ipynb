    "# Feature Engineering: data generation from existing datasets\n",
    "We are going to generate KPIs to get more meaningful and actionable insights from the existing dataset. These Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will help us better understand the relationships between different features in the dataset and will provide us with new, valuable information for training the machine learning model. By creating derived features such as price per square meter, price per room, and the relationship between bathrooms and bedrooms, we can enhance the model's ability to predict the target variable. Additionally, we will focus on generating new features that account for location-related factors, property characteristics, and the overall price adjustment based on area, helping us improve the model's accuracy and interpretability.\n"
